# Sudoku Solvers

These are sudoku solvers based around a 
[constraint propagation][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_consistency]
based search algorithm as described by
[Peter Norvig][https://norvig.com/sudoku.html].

The initial version was written in Python which I subsequently translated into
Clojure to see how easily it could be rewritten in a purely functional
language.
